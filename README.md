ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Mohamed Gharbou

ðŸŽ“ Master's Student in Fluid Mechanics
I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree, focusing on fluid mechanics. I have a strong interest in simulations, dimensional analysis, and pressure analysis, especially in the context of flow dynamics.

ðŸ’» Experience with ANSYS, SolidWorks, and Python
I've worked extensively with tools like ANSYS for simulation and pressure analysis, and SolidWorks for geometry creation. I'm also currently learning Python to enhance my computational skills and apply them to fluid mechanics challenges.

ðŸš€ Recent Projects
My recent projects include a detailed study on 'Simulation and Pressure Analysis of Flow Through a Fan' and a collaborative presentation on 'Dimensional Analysis and Similarity.' I enjoy working in teams and have collaborated with talented classmates like Maryam, Soulaimane, and Wissal on various projects.

Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, discussions, or any fluid mechanics-related queries.
